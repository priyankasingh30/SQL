Given the table schemas below, write a query to print the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, total number of managers, and total number of employees. Order your output by ascending company_code.

SELECT a.company_code, a.founder, b.lead_manager_count, c.senior_manager_count, d.manager_count, x.employee_count
FROM
(select *
from company) a
INNER JOIN
(select company_code, count( distinct lead_manager_code) AS lead_manager_count
from lead_manager
group by company_code) b
ON (a.company_code = b.company_code)
inner join
(select company_code, count( distinct senior_manager_code) as senior_manager_count
from senior_manager
group by company_code) c
on (a.company_code = c.company_code)
inner join
(select company_code, count(distinct manager_code) as manager_count
from manager
group by company_code) d
on (a.company_code = d.company_code)
inner join
(select company_code, count(distinct employee_code) as employee_count
from employee
group by company_code) x
on (a.company_code = x.company_code)
order by company_code;
